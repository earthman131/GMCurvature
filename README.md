# GMCurvature

Semblance coherence attribute for gravity and magnetic anomalies data

Developed by Lianghui Guo, 2011-2-13

# Principles

GMCurvature is a Matlab code for semblance coherence attribute analysis of gravity and magnetic anomalies data, benefiting in tectonic or geological body edge detection. It calculates the most positive attribute, the most negative attribute, and the hybrid positive-and-negative attribute of  the anomalies. The hybrid positive-and-negative curvature combines the most positive and most negative curvatures into one curvature by formula adjustments and weighted summation, combining the advantages of the two curvatures to improve edge detection. 

# Prerequisites

The code being implemented in MATLAB, it requires the MATLAB software, which is licensed under the MathWorks sofware company. MATLAB can be downloaded at the following link https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/, and more information can be found about the license fee on the website.

# Usage

To launch the program, it just requires to dowload ‘Matlab_Code’ from my repositories and execute the script GMCurvature.m on MATLAB.
