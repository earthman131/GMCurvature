# GMCurvature

Semblance coherence attribute for gravity and magnetic anomalies data

Developed by Lianghui Guo, 2011-2-13

# Principles

In work discussed in this paper the characteristics of both the most positive and most negative curvatures of a magnetic anomaly were analyzed, and a new approach for detection of the edges of magnetic anomalies is proposed. The new approach, called the hybrid positive-and-negative curvature approach, combines the most positive and most negative curvatures into one curvature by formula adjustments and weighted summation, combining the advantages of the two curvatures to improve edge detection. This approach is suitable for vertically magnetized or reduction-to-pole anomalies, which avoids the complexity of magnetic anomalies caused by oblique magnetization. Testing on synthetic vertically magnetized magnetic anomalies data demonstrated that the hybrid approach traces the edges of magnetic source bodies effectively, discriminates between high and low magnetism intuitively, and is better than approaches based solely on use of the most positive or most negative curvature. 

# Prerequisites
